    sources.

    AVAILABLE SOURCES:

    YouTube Videos/Channels:
    {youtube_links}

    Web Pages/Articles/Code Documentation:
    {webpage_links}

    Research Papers:
    {research_paper_links}

    Documents (PDF/Text/Markdown):
    {document_paths}

    YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:

    1. Identify which source types are provided (non-empty).
    2. Delegate research tasks to appropriate specialists:
      - YouTube Specialist: for youtube_links
      - Web Specialist: for webpage_links
      - Arxiv Specialist: for research_paper_links
      - Document Specialist: for document_paths

    3. Collect all the research findings from each of the specialist engaged.
    4. Compile everything into ONE comprehensive research report
      that includes:
        - Executive Summary of all sources.
        - Detailed findings organized by source type.
        - All technical concepts, methods and implementations.
        - Code examples and practical demos. (In proper code blocks)
        - Best practices and tutorials.
        - Step by Step guides and walkthroughs.
        - Any charts or flows described as text.

    CRITICAL RULES:
      - Do Not shorten or summarize content - include EVERYTHING discovered.
      - If a source field is empty, skip that source type entirely.
      - Only Delegate to specialists whose source type has content.
      - Provide a concise but complete research summary (200-300 words).
      - Focus on 3–5 key technical insights
      - Avoid repetition and excessive verbosity.
      - Include complete citations and links for all sources.
